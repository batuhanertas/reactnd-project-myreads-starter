# MyReads Project

This project was built on the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.
It is a application for tracking books. User can categorize its books in 3 different shelves (Currently Reading, Want to Read, Read).
User is able to switch the shelf of a book or can completely remove a book from the shelves by selecting the option 'None'.
In addition the application has a search feature. The user can search books only for provided search terms (they can be found in the
'SEARCH_TERM.md' file). User can add any book from the search results to any shelf. If any book is already in any shelf,
its shelf will be highlighted in the dropdown menu of this book.

This project requires only the following two steps to steps to be launched:
 > npm install
 > npm start
